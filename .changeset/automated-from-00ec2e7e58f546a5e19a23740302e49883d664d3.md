[#1376](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1376) : legacy addon resolving : _by [@ef4](https://github.com/ef4)_

This adds the ability to intercept module resolution requests to and from addons that have been rewritten from v1 to v2.

It's what will allow resolving modules without needing to physically rewrite the node_modules tree.
