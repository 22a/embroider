# Stack

 - make sure `ember s` works
 - write README, publish to npm, open repos
 - there's a weird babel bug that forced me to rename some locals in travis
 - make sure we are following the same addon traversal order as ember-cli: https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/7979
 - when adding tests, see https://github.com/stefanpenner/node-fixturify-project (as used in ember-cli)
